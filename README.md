👋 Hi, I’m @nerzhul250.

## Research & Projects

### **Active Work**  

#### **AI/ML Research** 🧠  
- Experimenting with **model interpretability, merging, and efficient training** (lots of toy experiments and sailing through the latent space). 
- Experimenting with fully autonomous scientific research systems like [**AI-Scientist**](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist-v2)
- Building practical AI tools—like [**AntiAICall**](https://antiaicall.com/), an assistant that screens calls and blocks telemarketers 🤖📞.  

#### **Quantitative Finance** 📈  
- Developed [**Quantty.io**](https://quantty.io/), a platform for **AI-assisted market data analysis (BTCUSD,APPL...)** (Data management, AI assisted hypothesis testing, automatic hypothesis exploration (inspired by the AI scientist v2)).
- Still in testing phase, DM me if interested.

#### **Tech lead at Swiset**
- Just helping so it doesn't catch fire in mid-flight XD [**Swiset.com**](https://swiset.com/)

### **Deep-Dive Research** 🔍  

#### **Cryptography** 🔐  
- Investigating **SECP256K1 vulnerabilities**—check a survey that i helped gpt do:  
  → ["Trying to Attack SECP256K1 (2025)"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trying-attack-secp256k1-2025-sebastian-arango-vergara-s3fyc/)

### **My theoretical dreams**

#### **Computational Biology** 🌱  
- *Reading* about **gene editing (CRISPR), AlphaFold, Evo2 and evolutionary algorithms**—future applications in crop improvement (specially interested in coffe, sugar canes and avocado crops, quite popular crops where i live (Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia).  

#### **Autonomous Systems & Robotics** ✈️🤖  
- *Exploring* drone food delivery/logistics in the city of Cali,Colombia (theoretical for now, would love to order food km away from where i live, funding is welcomed).
- Imagine automating everything in the physical world, we are gonna need really nice supply chains, and the chatgpt moment in robotics :)))
